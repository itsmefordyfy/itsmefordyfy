# Hi there, I'm Clifford! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

With over 9+ years of software engineering experience and a degree in Information Technology majoring in Software Engineering, I specialize in building high-quality mobile applications that deliver real-world impact.

My core expertise lies in React Native, where I design and develop cross-platform apps for iOS and Android—from MVPs to full-featured products—for industries such as fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce.

I’ve collaborated with global teams and startup founders, contributing to product design, feature planning, and performance optimization. Whether it's integrating native modules, handling push notifications, or publishing to App Store and Play Store, I deliver with precision and efficiency.

💡 Core Strengths:
- Mobile App Development: Scalable, intuitive apps built with React Native and Expo.
- API Integration: Secure backend communication using REST, GraphQL, Firebase, or AWS.
- Cross-Platform Performance: Optimized UI/UX, native feel, and real-time features like chat and push notifications.

I follow Agile practices, prioritize clear communication, and always aim for fast, maintainable code.

Let’s build mobile solutions that make a difference—whether you're launching a new product or enhancing an existing one.
