Building Smarter, Faster MVPs with AI & React Native | Leveraging AI Tools for Rapid Prototyping & Scalable Apps | 9+ Years Experience

## About Me

With over 9 years of software engineering experience and a degree in Information Technology (Software Engineering), I specialize in building AI-accelerated mobile applications that transform ideas into scalable, real-world solutions.

My core expertise lies in React Native, where I design and develop cross-platform apps for iOS and Android—from rapid AI-assisted MVPs to production-grade products across fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce industries.

I leverage AI coding tools and automation workflows to accelerate development, enhance scalability, and deliver cleaner, more maintainable code—helping startups and teams ship faster and smarter.

I’ve collaborated with global teams and startup founders, contributing to product design, feature planning, and performance optimization. From integrating native modules, push notifications, and analytics, to publishing apps on the App Store and Google Play, I deliver with precision and efficiency.

💡 Core Strengths:

AI-Driven Development: Using AI tools to streamline coding, debugging, and scaling apps efficiently.

Mobile App Development: Scalable, intuitive cross-platform apps with React Native and Expo.

API Integration: Secure, optimized backend communication with REST, GraphQL, Firebase, or AWS.

Cross-Platform Performance: Native-like experiences with real-time features like chat, notifications, and offline sync.

I follow Agile practices, value clear communication, and always aim for fast, reliable, and scalable solutions.

🚀 Let’s build smart mobile experiences that leverage AI to scale faster and deliver meaningful impact—whether you're launching a new idea or elevating your existing product.
